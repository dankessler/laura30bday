Abstract
We propose a regression-based approach to removing implicit biases in representations. On
tasks where the protected attribute is observed, the
method is statistically more efficient than known
approaches. Further, we show that this approach
leads to debiased representations that satisfy a
first order approximation of conditional parity. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
approach by reducing racial bias in recidivism
risk scores.

1. Introduction
In practice, the use of algorithms does not remove all human
bias from decision making. There are numerous examples
of algorithms with outcomes that are unfair to members of
different protected classes (see e.g. Angwin et al. (2016),
Steel & Angwin (2010)). In recent years, there has been a
flurry of work aimed at correcting this issue. Starting with
(Dwork et al., 2011), this work has generally fallen into four
categories:
1. Mathematical or statistical definitions of fairness (e.g.
Friedler et al. (2016), Ritov et al. (2017)).
2. Algorithms that are modeled to ensure fairness (e.g.
Joseph et al. (2016)).
3. Methods of preprocessing data in order to remove inherent bias so that algorithms trained on the debiased
data will be fair (e.g. Zemel et al. (2013), Feldman
et al. (2015)).
4. Methods of debiasing the outcomes of existing algorithms (a postprocessing step; e.g. Hardt et al. (2016)).
This work falls into the third category of preprocessing. We
introduce a factor model prevalent in genetics applications
to model the contributions of the protected and permissible
attributes to the representation. By treating the variation that
is present in the data due to protected attributes (e.g. race)

as unwanted, we devise a method to remove this unwanted
variation based on the factor model (and thus debias the
data). We show that under certain idealized conditions, the
debiased representation is conditionally uncorrelated with
the protected attributes. In other words, it satisfies a first
order approximation of conditional parity (Ritov et al., 2017)
in these cases.
1.1. Motivating example
We use ProPublica’s COMPAS dataset and COMPAS risk
recidivism scores as an example throughout. More information can be found from (Angwin et al., 2016) and the
Practitioners Guide to COMPAS 1 . Much has been written
questioning the fairness of these scores with respect to race,
with concerns about the disparate false negative and false
positive rates between African-Americans and Caucasians.
Notation: We denote matrices by uppercase greek or Latin
characters and vectors by lowercase characters. A (single)
subscript on a matrix indexes its rows (unless otherwise
stated). A random matrix X ∈ Rn×d is distributed according to a matrix-variate normal distribution with mean M ∈
Rn×d , row covariance Σr ∈ Rn×n , and column covariance
Σc ∈ Rd×d , which we denote by X ∼ MN(M, Σr , Σc ).

2. Related Work
The factor model that motivates the proposed approach
(Equation 3.1) is widely used in genetics and was first introduced by (Leek & Storey, 2008) to represent wanted and
unwanted variation in gene expression data. It was further
exploited by (Gagnon-Bartsch et al., 2013) to develop the
removing unwanted variation (RUV) family of methods.
RUV methods rely on knowledge of a set of control genes:
genes whose variation in their expression levels are solely
attributed to variation in Z, for example, genes unaffected
by the treatments. Formally, a set of controls is a set of
indices I ⊂ [d] such that BI = 0. Thus
YI = XATI + EI ,
where YI and EI consist of subsets of the columns of Y and

and W , in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

Our goal is to obtain debiased representations Ydb such that

E, which suggests estimating ATI by linear regression. This
is precisely the “transpose” of the method that we advocate.
The task of debiasing features was studied by (Lum &
Johndrow, 2016), but there are a few differences between
their approach and the proposed one. First, their approach
creates new features that satisfy unconditional rather than
conditional parity. Second, their approach entails estimating
the conditional distributions of the features. This is hard in
general, especially if the features are high-dimensional.

3. Adjusting for protected attributes
Consider the widely adopted model for matrix-variate data:
Y
(n×d)

= X

AT + Z B T + E .

(n×k)(k×d)

(n×l)(l×d)

(n×d)

(3.1)

The rows of Y are representations, the rows of X (resp. Z)
are protected attributes (resp. permissible attributes) of the
samples, and the rows of E are error terms that represent
idiosyncratic variation in the representations. In this paper,
we assume k, l  d, but this low-dimensionality is not
requisite for the use of the algorithms presented here.
In practice, Y is usually observed, X is sometimes observed,
and Z is unobserved. For example, in (Bolukbasi et al.,
2016), the representations are embeddings of words in the
vocabulary, and the protected attribute is the gender bias of
(the embeddings of) words. The rows of Z are unobserved
factor loadings that represent the “good” variation in the
word embeddings. In analogy to the framework in (Friedler
et al., 2016), the rows of Z are points in the construct space
while the rows of Y are points in the observed space. We
emphasize that like the construct space, Z is unobserved.
We highlight that we permit non-trivial correlation between
the protected and permissible attributes. In other words, we
allow the protected attribute to confound the relationship
between the permissible attribute and the representation (see
Figure 1 for a graphical representation of the dependencies
between the rows of Y , X, and Z). This complicates the
task of debiasing the representations. To keep things simple,
we assume the regression of Z on X is linear:
Z = X
(n×l)

ΓT + W .

(n×k)(k×l)

(n×l)

(3.2)

The rows of W are error terms that represent variation in
the permissible attributes not attributed to variation in the

(3.3)

This is implied by conditional parity: [Ydb ]i ⊥ xi | zi , and
we consider (3.3) as a first-order approximation of conditional parity. An ideal debiased representation is the variation in the representation attributed to the permissible attributes ZB T , but this is typically unobservable in practice.
3.0.1. COMPAS EXAMPLE
Under this model, each row of Y corresponds to a person’s
data for recidivism prediction. In our experiments, this
includes age, juvenile and adult felony and misdemeanor
counts, and whether the offense was a misdemeanor or
felony. In this case, X is a vector, and each component
indicates the person’s race. We restrict to Caucasians and
African-Americans in our experiments. A persons’s true
propensity to choose to commit a crime, Z, is unknown.
3.1. Homogeneous subgroups
The proposed approach relies crucially on knowledge of
homogeneous subgroups: groups of samples in which the
variation in their representations is mostly attributed to variation in their protected attributes. Formally, we presume
knowledge of sets of indices I1 , . . . , IG ⊂ [n] such that
Hg ZIg ≈ 0, where Hg = I|Ig | − |I1g | 1|Ig | 1T|Ig | is the centering matrix, for any g ∈ [G]. In other words,
Hg YIg ≈ Hg XIg AT + Hg E.
Ideally, Hg ZIg exactly vanishes. This ideal situation arises
when the samples in the g-th group share permissible attributes: ZIg = 1|Ig | zgT for some zg ∈ Rl .
Intuitively, homogeneous subgroups are groups of samples
in which we expect a machine learning algorithm that only
discriminates by the permissible attributes to treat similarly.
For example, in (Bolukbasi et al., 2016), the homogeneous
subgroups are pairs of words that differ only in their gender
bias: (waiter, waitress), (king, queen).
3.1.1. COMPAS EXAMPLE
In Section 4, we take the homogeneous groups to be people
who either did not recidivate within two years or people
who did recidivate within two years and were charged with
the same degree of felony or misdemeanor. Although Z is
unknown, we expect subjects who go on to commit similar
crimes or those who do not recidivate to have similar Z

regardless of race. We emphasize that the homogeneous
subgroups are not defined by having similar attributes in Y .
3.2. Adjustment when the protected attribute is
unobserved
We now show that the approach proposed by Bolukbasi et al.
(2016) produces debiased representations that satisfy (3.3).
When the protected attributes are not observed, it is generally not possible to attribute variation in the representations
to variation in the protected and permissible attributes. Thus,
Bolukbasi et al. (2016) settle on removing the variation in
the representations in the subspace spanned by the protected
attributes. In other words, we debias the representations by
projecting them onto the orthocomplement of R(A).
Formally, let Qg ∈ R|Ig |×(|Ig |−1) be a subunitary matrix
such that R(Qg ) coincides with R(Hg ). Under (3.4),
QTg YIg ≈ QTg XIg + QTg E,


which implies Cov QTg YIg ≈ ΣE + AAT . This is a factor
model, which allows us to consistently estimate A by factor
analysis under mild conditions. We impose classical sufficient conditions for identifiability of A (Anderson & Rubin,
1956):
1. Let A−i be the (d − 1) × k submatrix of A consisting
of all but the i-th row of A. For any i ∈ [n], there are
two disjoint submatrices of A−i of rank k.
2. AT Σ−1
E A is diagonal, and the diagonal entries are distinct, positive, and arranged in decreasing order.
We remark that the additional assumptions we imposed in
this section are a tad stronger than necessary: the assumptions actually imply identifiability of A, but we only wish
to estimate R(A).
In light of the preceding development, here is a natural
approach to adjustment when the protected attribute is unobserved:
1. estimate A P
by factor analysis:
G
arg min{ 12 g=1 kHg YIg − XAk2F };
2. debias Y by projection onto R(A)⊥ :
Ydb = Y (I − PR(A) ),
which gives

the representations by subtracting X A . We summarize the
approach in Algorithm 1.

similarly.

To study the properties of Algorithm 1, we impose the following assumptions on the distributions of X, E, and W :
X ∼ MN(0, In , Σx ),
E | (X, Z) ∼ MN(0, In , Σ ).

Proposition 3.1. Let Zg and Eg be defined similarly as Yg

The (conditional) bias in the OLS estimator of A depends

(conditionally) unbiased estimator of A.
Proposition 3.2. Under conditions (3.1), (3.2), and (3.4),
we have
b i , xi | zi ] = −BCov[Z̃ X̃(X̃ T X̃)† xi , xi |zi ].
Cov[yi − Ax
We see that if Â = A or Z̃ = 0 then the debiased yi is
uncorrelated with the protected attributes xi .

4. Experiments: Debiased representations for
recidivism risk scores

3.3. Adjustment if the protected attribute is observed

We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of Algorithm 1
for reducing racial bias in recidivism risk scores based on
data ProPublica 2 used in their investigation of COMPAS
scores. We fit our own models to the raw and debiased data.
Although simple, the scores output by our model perform
comparably to the proprietary COMPAS scores (see Figure
2 and Table 3).

If the protected attribute is observed, it is straightfoward
to debias the representations. The main challenge here is

https://github.com/propublica/compasanalysis/blob/master/compas-scores-two-years.csv

Cov[[Ydb ]i , xi |zi ] = Cov[PR(A)⊥ (Bzi + ei )|zi ] = 0.
Note that when B ⊂ R(A) the debiased representations
will be non-informative because they only contain noise.

Figure 2.

In particular, we show that logistic regression (LR) trained
on debiased data obtained from Algorithm 1 reduces the
magnitude of the difference in the false positive rates (FPR)
and false negative rates (FNR) between Caucasians and
African-Americans (AA) compared to LR trained on raw,
potentially biased data. This “fairer” outcome is achieved
with a relatively small impact on the percentage of correct
predictions. The variables in our LR model are discussed in
Section 3.0.1.
We split our data into three pieces: a training set used to
estimate A from Equation (3.1), and a train and test set
to evaluate the performance of the learned model. Figure
3 shows the distribution of the probabilities of recidivism
for African-Americans according to a logistic model based
on the raw and debiased representations. The distribution
of the probabilities from the raw representation is skewed
to the right. In particular, the right tail of the distribution
of probabilities from the raw representation is noticeably
heavier than that from the debiased representation.
The ROC curve of the LR model trained on raw data is
similar to the ROC curve of COMPAS scores validating the
choice of LR as a proxy for COMPAS scores. See Figure
2. For the remaining discussion, we average all results over
30 splits of the data into train and test sets. The average
accuracy (the percentage of correct predictions) is 65% for
COMPAS. The accuracy for LR trained on raw data and
debiased data is comparable, again validating our proxy
and justifying the slight loss in accuracy after debiasing in
pursuit of fairer outcomes. See Table 3.
Table 1 and Table 2 show the average FPR and FNR for the
LR model before and after debiasing. The two tables differ
only in the threshold used to declare someone at risk for recidivism based on his or her logistic score; we choose to examine the 50th and 80th quantiles of LR scores since Northpointe specifies that COMPAS scores above the of 50th
(respectively 80th) quantile are said to indicate a “Medium”
(respectively “High”) risk of recidivism. In Table 1, we
see that there is no difference in FPR after debiasing. The

debiased representations for African-Americans.

difference in FNR between the races goes from nearly 20%
before debiasing to 4% after debiasing. In Table 2, we see
FNR are nearly equalized, whereas the magnitude of the
difference of FPR between both race groups is improved.
However, now Caucasians suffer from disparate impact of
FPR instead of African-Americans.

5. Summary and discussion
We study a factor model of representations that explicitly
models the contributions of the protected and permissible
attributes. Based on the model, we propose an approach
to debias the representations. We show that under certain
conditions, we can guarantee first order conditional parity
for the debiased representations.
